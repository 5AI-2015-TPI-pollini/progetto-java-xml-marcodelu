# WeatherProject
This is the branch dedicated to GitHub Pages of WeatherProject which is a software that searches for an address and shows the weather informations.
You can find the Stable version at: http://5ai-2015-tpi-pollini.github.io/progetto-java-xml-simonedegiacomi/


## How does it work?
The software uses JavaFX to provide a GUI and Google GeoCode API to search the coordinates of the given address. Once the coordinates are found, the weather informations are retrieved from OpenWeatherMap.
