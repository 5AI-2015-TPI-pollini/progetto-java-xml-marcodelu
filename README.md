## What is
DeluWather is the result of a task assigned by Prof. Pollini Andrea for the school year 2015/16.
It's a program that checks the weather for an address inserted by the user.

## How does it work
DeluWeather works using Google Maps and OpenWeather APIs for retrieving data in XML, after it shows the result on screen using JavaFX.
